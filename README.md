Project description:
The project Tails of joy is the website to find new puppies for sale and the dogs for adoption.
It helps to reserve puppies and dogs you are interested in.
You can reserve puppies by filling the reservation form with the interested puppy or dog ID.
I will get back to you once the form is submitted with the required details.
You can also just admire the puppies and dogs from my page.

Project details:
The project consists of:
HTML page - main.html, adopt.html, sale.html and form.html
CSS page - style.css

Future improvements:
1. To make it more comfortable for the users, we will make both buying and adopting online so that we will deliver to you at home.
2. Will provide more details about individual dog breeds like their life span, size details, etc. so that it will be more easy to select the dog suitable for you and your habitation.
3. We will also expand the breed varieties as per customer request.
4. We will also make a video chatting facility for selecting the dogs.
